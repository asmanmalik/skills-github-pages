# 🚀 A Journey into Open Source with ETL’s OSPC Initiative

*By Asma Malik*

## 🌱 How It Started

When I joined the ETL Executive Team, I knew I wanted to work on something meaningful—something that blends education, collaboration, and real-world impact. That opportunity came in the form of **ETL’s Open Source Project Contribution (OSPC) Initiative**.

At its core, OSPC is about **empowering students** to go beyond tutorials and certificates. It’s about enabling them to **contribute to real open-source projects**, guided by mentors and supported by a community that believes in learning by doing.

## 🛠 What We’re Building

The OSPC initiative is more than just a GitHub repository. It's a thoughtfully designed ecosystem that includes:

- ✅ A structured learning pathway from training → onboarding → contribution
- 🤝 Mentorship from experienced professionals
- 📂 Open source projects that are student-friendly, mission-driven, and technically relevant
- 🧰 A full **Contributor Toolkit** (README templates, Git workflows, RACI charts, issue templates, and more)
- 🧪 Real-life engineering practices: code reviews, CI pipelines, branching strategies

## 🔍 The Contributor Experience

Each student is invited to participate in projects selected specifically for their growth potential. They are:

1. **Onboarded with care** – via checklists, project kick-off sessions, and a toolkit that removes ambiguity.
2. **Supported constantly** – through WhatsApp, GitHub Discussions, and weekly check-ins with mentors.
3. **Celebrated meaningfully** – their contributions are merged, credited, and even demoed in public showcases.

For many, this is their *first GitHub PR*. For some, their first experience collaborating in a team. And for all, it's a step forward in becoming open-source contributors for life.

## 📈 Impact So Far

We’ve seen students go from “I’m not sure where to start” to “I just opened my third pull request!”

The OSPC program has:

- ✅ Issued dozens of open-source contributor certificates
- 🚀 Launched two student-led projects into execution
- 💬 Facilitated real-world conversations between junior and senior devs
- 🏗 Built confidence in students to solve real-world problems collaboratively

## 💡 Why It Matters

In today’s world, **open source is the new résumé**. By working openly, sharing code, reviewing contributions, and solving actual problems, students don’t just learn—they grow into professionals.

At ETL, we believe that **giving back is learning forward**. And that’s what OSPC is all about.
